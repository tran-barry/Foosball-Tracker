BARRY'S FOOSBALL TRACKER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION

Around the office we play foosball, but we don’t have any ways to know who is
the best.  This is a simple application that takes the outcome of games to
create a leaderboard.  These will only be head to head games (one player per
team).
 
In this application, you can enter the 2 players, and the resulting winner and
loser. We can also display a players Win/Loss record, and sort by win percent.
 
At the base, you should be able to:
   - Create a Player record
   - Create a Match Record (which players played, and what was the result)
   - Search players and see their match history
   - Have persistent storage – so the application shouldn’t reset each time you
     close it

This application will be done in C#.
